# Ideas

- Bug: failed tests are not updated to the passed after success
- Update test names after file change
- Add test failed result
- Running parent test should properly parse children results
- Parse stderr execution duration
- Run spec tests
- Run ecomp tests
- Run mcomp tests
- Add tests
- [Bundling](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension#using-webpack) with Webpack

# Can't resolve

- DO: reset test results after window reload
- DO: reset test results after file reopening
- DO [reset test results after file change](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/testing#publishonly-controllers)
- DON'T: mark parent tests result as particular test run results
